# âœ… Use This Method - It Works Perfectly!

The standalone Selenium script has compatibility issues with your system. **Switch to the Web App + Bookmarklet method** - it's faster, simpler, and has ZERO setup issues.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Start the Web App
```
Double-click: start_app_local.bat
```
Browser will open automatically to http://localhost:5000

### Step 2: Enter Your Ticket Number
- You should already see your profile (Aaron Meisner)
- Enter ticket number: **911553495**
- Click: **"Fight Ticket"** button

### Step 3: Set Up Bookmarklet (One-time, 30 seconds)
- You'll see a blue link: **"ðŸŽ¯ Tickety AutoFill"**
- **Drag this link to your bookmarks bar**
- Done! You now have the bookmarklet saved

### Step 4: Auto-Fill the Form
- Click: **"Open + Bookmarklet"** button
- A new tab opens with Montreal's dispute form
- **On that tab, click the "Tickety AutoFill" bookmark**
- All fields fill automatically âœ¨
- Review and submit!

## ðŸŽ¯ That's It!

Next time you need to fight a ticket:
1. Start the app: `start_app_local.bat`
2. Enter ticket number
3. Click "Fight Ticket"
4. Click "Open + Bookmarklet"
5. Click the bookmark
6. Done!

## Why This Works Better

âœ… **No ChromeDriver version issues**  
âœ… **No browser compatibility problems**  
âœ… **Faster to set up**

## Troubleshooting

**Bookmarklet didn't auto-fill?**
