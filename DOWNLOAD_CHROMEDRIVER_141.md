## Why This Happened
- Chrome auto-updates to new versions
- Your ChromeDriver didn't update
- They now don't match (139 vs 141)

## Alternative: Auto-Download
If you want to skip manual downloading, we can also:
1. Disable Selenium for now
2. Use the **Web App + Bookmarklet** method instead
3. It works perfectly and has no ChromeDriver issues
