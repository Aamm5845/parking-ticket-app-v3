# ðŸš— Test the Fixed Fight Ticket Button

## âœ… ChromeDriver is Working!
Your test showed ChromeDriver works perfectly. The browser closed because that was just a test.

## ðŸ”§ What I Fixed:
- **Browser now stays open** after filling the form
- **No automatic closing** on success
- **Better error handling** 
- **Proper timing** for form filling

## ðŸš€ Test the Fight Ticket Button:

### Step 1: Start the App
```bash
python app.py
```

### Step 2: Open Browser
Go to: http://localhost:5000

### Step 3: Set Up Profile
- Click "Set Up My Profile"
- Fill in your information:
  - **Name**: Your name
  - **Email**: AAMM5845@GMAIL.COM
  - **License**: Your license number
  - **Address**: Your address
  - **City**: Montreal
  - **Postal Code**: Your postal code
- Click "Save Profile"

### Step 4: Test Fight Ticket Button
1. **Enter ticket number**: `123456789` (any 9 digits)
2. **Click "Fight Ticket"** button
3. **Expected result:**
   - Chrome browser opens
   - Montreal dispute page loads
   - Form gets filled automatically:
     - âœ… Ticket number: 123456789
     - âœ… Your personal info
     - âœ… Random explanation message
   - **Browser stays open** for you to review and submit

### Step 5: Review and Submit
- Check all the filled information
- Make any corrections needed
- Click submit to actually file your dispute

## ðŸ§ª Alternative Test (Direct):

If the button still doesn't work, test the endpoint directly:

```bash
python test_fight_ticket.py
```

This will:
1. Set up a test profile automatically
2. Call the Fight Ticket automation directly
3. Tell you if it worked

## ðŸŽ¯ What You Should See:

1. **Button clicked** â†’ Shows "Opening Montreal Form..." 
2. **Chrome launches** â†’ Opens automatically
3. **Form loads** â†’ Montreal dispute page appears
4. **Auto-filling happens** â†’ Watch the form fill itself
5. **Success message** â†’ Browser stays open with filled form
6. **You take over** â†’ Review and submit manually

## ðŸ”§ If It Still Doesn't Work:

1. **Check console messages** (F12 in browser)
2. **Make sure profile is set up**
3. **Try the direct test**: `python test_fight_ticket.py`
4. **Check if any error messages appear**

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Looks Like:

- Chrome opens with Montreal dispute form
- All your information is pre-filled
- Browser stays open for you to submit
- No more closing immediately!

**The Fight Ticket button should now work exactly as you wanted!** ðŸš—ðŸ’¨
